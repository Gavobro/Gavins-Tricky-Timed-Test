# What did I do?
- Assigned variables to lowercase, uppercase, and number values.
- Created a prompt and asked how long your personal password will be from 8-128 characters in length.
- Created checkboxes asking if the user wants lowercase, uppercase and/or numbers in their password.
- Made a randomizer for the values of the password.
